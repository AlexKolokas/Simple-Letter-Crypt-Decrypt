# SIMPLE LETTER ENCRYPTION & DECRYPTION (S.L.E.D)

**S.L.E.D.** is a command line project for easy and simple encryption and after that decryption of letters. 
You run the program and you decide if you want to encrypt a letter or decrypt a code.
If you want to encrypt a letter you giving the letter as input and you take as output the code and a key.
In the other hand if you have a code and a key(maybe someone send it to you) you can run the program give as input the code and the key and the program it will give you back the letter.

## Helping Terms
NumberOfLetters= The number of letters t
## The Encryption Formula

- `The code of the letter` is   
- `The Key of the letter` is


## Examples

- **Letter G** : `code`=5050 , `key`=4

- **Letter S** : `code`=479001606 , `key`=37

- **Letter Z** : `code`=479001610 , `key`=414
